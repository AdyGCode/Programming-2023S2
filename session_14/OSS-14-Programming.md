### Cluster / Unit Summaries
Diploma Adv Prog: Intermediate Programming for Robotics and IoT

This cluster covers the implementation of solutions for interfacing hardware, software, the outside world and people. It focusses on the use of IoT and Robotics Microcontrollers such as the Arduino 3, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. Coding is completed using Arduino C, Python and other languages as needed. The cluster investigates and applies principles of application security including encryption and Role Based Access Control. It also covers basic electronics and power consumption. The cluster contains a series of portfolio challenges that require the student to apply what is learned and to problem solve for solutions to issues as they arise.

### Introduction to Programming for Robotics and IoT (C4)
- Investigating alternative solutions to the project requirements
- Raf did a walk through today of the project (? recorded on collaborate)

### C# Data Binding WPF/UWP 
- Could Aaron do an online session? 
- Does not need to be Weds night
- If not could he record a tutorial on its use and application?

### Employability
- Employers are interested in your technical skills...
- But they are MORE interested in your personal skills
	- communication
	- teamwork
	- reliability
	- promptness
	- work ethic
	- et al

### Practice Projects

A good way to improve your skills is to do mini (or bigger) projects.
If you do decide to start a project... see it to the end!
Keep it simple to start with.
Use version control.
Once the simple solution is complete, make a list of enhancements and target one at a time.
