##### dBeaver hiccup with Stored Procedure Creation

 - It has been noted that dBeaver will not work as expected when defining a Stored procedure using SQL.
	 - If you get an error such as:
		   ![SQL Error for stored procedure](../media/image-20231120150848.png)
		   
	 - Then SELECT the whole query (as shown below) and execute that 'statement' by right clicking the selection, hover over Execute and then select *Execute SQL Script*.
	   ![Execute SQL Script](../media/image-20231120150056.png)
		   
	- Alternatively, use `ALT`+`X` to execute the selected lines:
	   ![ALT X shortcut to execute script](../media/image-20231120152604.png)
		   
	- Another item you could do is to drop the procedure before creating the procedure:
	  ![Drop procedure](../media/image-20231120150818.png)
