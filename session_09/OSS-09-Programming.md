Get them questions ready!
Subject / Topic  and the question itself üòä

### Tuples in Python
- what are they
- how they work
- using them

### JS - #923 Check


### SQL and Nested Queries 
We started to look at SQL nested queries, but could not resolve a problem during the scheduled time.

Adrian spent a while after and managed to resolve the issue. The link here shows the DDL and the DML files to the sample data and queries.

It has been updated since that time, and Session 12 has a link to these files also.
