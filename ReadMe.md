### Requests for Assistance

Asking for assistance is an important skill.

When asking in class, make sure you explain the problem clearly. Doing this often will help you solve your own problems.

This is part of what is known as **Rubber Duck Debugging**.

This then applies to when you are seeking assistance via eMail or via Teams chat.

### Help Desk

The Help Desk is one of the ways we provide 
assistance to all students.

- https://help.screencraft.net.au

Our help desk system has a ticketing component where you email your queries, and a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section for commonly requested items.

The links below will take you to the FAQs and a 
method to log in to the Help Desk to view your 
tickets.
