## Questions?!

Get them questions ready!
Subject / Topic and the question itself 😊

### SQL

Join Queries 7: Income and Expenditures

### AI and Answering Questions

- BE HONEST!
- If you use an AI tool, identify what used for EACH answer.
- If it is ChatGPT or similar (eg Bing) then you must provide the transcript of the conversations.

### Cluster / Unit Summaries

We are creating summaries and other details to provide future and current students with an idea of what is being covered
in each unit/cluster.
For example:
> Diploma Adv Prog: Intermediate Programming for Robotics and IoT
>
> This cluster covers the implementation of solutions for interfacing hardware, software, the outside world and people.
> It focusses on the use of IoT and Robotics Microcontrollers such as the Arduino 3, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. Coding is
> completed using Arduino C, Python and other languages as needed. The cluster investigates and applies principles of
> application security including encryption and Role Based Access Control. It also covers basic electronics and power
> consumption. The cluster contains a series of portfolio challenges that require the student to apply what is learned and
> to problem solve for solutions to issues as they arise.

### Introduction to Programming for Robotics and IoT (C4)

- Investigating alternative solutions to the project requirements
- Raf did a walk through today of the project (? recorded on collaborate)

### C# Data Binding WPF/UWP

- Could Aaron do an online session?
- Does not need to be Weds night
- If not could he record a tutorial on its use and application?

### Employability

- Employers are interested in your technical skills...
- But they are MORE interested in your personal skills
    - communication
    - teamwork
    - reliability
    - promptness
    - work ethic
    - et al

### Practice Projects

A good way to improve your skills is to do mini (or bigger) projects.
If you do decide to start a project... see it to the end!
Keep it simple to start with.
Use version control.
Once the simple solution is complete, make a list of enhancements and target one at a time.
