## Challenges / Learning to Code

These sites may be free or paid, and they may offer free access under certain conditions. They also range from assisting you to learn to assessing your skills. They may not be relevant to this stage of your learning.

We do not have any favourites, and not all have been looked at.

## Questions

What does it mean to be signed and unsigned?

Signed + or -
- Byte -128 ... 127
Unsigned + only
- Byte: 0 ... 255

Byte:
- 2 Nybbles
- 8 bits

Joke: Bits Nybbles Bytes Chew Mouthful Lunch

Byte: 00000000
Unsigned: 00000000 ... 11111111

00000000 0 -- 
00000001 1 -- `1 * 2^0` = `1 * `1 = 1
00000010 2 -- `1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0` = `2 + 0` = 2
00000011 3 -- `1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0` = `2 + 1` = 3
...
11111111 255 - `1 * 2^7 + 1 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3+ 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0` = `128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1`

2^0 = `1`
2^1 = `2`
2^2 = `2 * 2` = 4
2^3 = `2 * 2 * 2` = 8
...
2^7 = `2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2` = 128

Powers of 2 from 2^0 up...
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 ... 


#### Signed:
Snnnnnnn = 01111111 = 127
Snnnnnnn = 11111111 = -128

As processors got more powerful, they could handle larger and larger integers... most could work with numbers that were (often) double the processor "bit size", eg: 32-bit processor.

8 bit
16 bit
32 bit
64 bit
128 bit

32 bit unsigned = `2^32 - 1`

8 bit unsigned = `2^8 - 1` = `256 - 1` = 255

#### Decimal
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 

#### Hexadecimal
0-15 - 4 bits
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
0 .. 15

10 (Hex) = 1 * 16^1 + 0 = 16
B5 (hex) = 11 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0 = 11 * 16 + 5  = 176 + 5 = 181
